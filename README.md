# Mashroom Portal Quickstart

Quickstart template for the [Mashroom Server](https://www.mashroom-server.com) Portal, an **Integration Platform for Microfrontends**.

This template demonstrates how to integrate a standalone React app into the Portal.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js >= 18

## Start the server

* npm install
* npm start

Open [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050) in your browser.

Available users:

* john/john
* admin/admin

If you start the server without NODE_ENV set it will be in development mode and automatically detect changes in the
plugin-packages folder and hot reload plugins.

So, if you place the *Example React App* on a page and change its code it will be reloaded automatically.

### Docker

To run the server within a docker container:

    npm run docker:create-image
    npm run docker:start

### Production hints

To run the server in cluster mode you can start it with PM2 like so:

    NODE_ENV=production pm2 start ./mashroom-starter -i max

### Start the React app in development mode

    npm run setup
    cd plugin-packages/example-react-app
    npm run dev

## Configuration

There is a set of configuration files for development and production in the config folder.

* Server config: *mashroom.json*
* Log4js config: *log4js.json* or *log4js.js*
* URL pattern based access control: *acl.json*
* Users for simple security provider: *users.json*
* The list of remote portal apps: *remote-portal-apps.json*

## Storage

The Portal configuration will be stored in _data/storage_. Typically, you would put the json files there
under version control.

## Plugins

This quickstart template consists of an example React Portal App, an example Theme, example Layouts and an example HTTP Proxy Interceptor.
The example Theme uses the *handlebars* template engine but you can use every available engine for *express*.
Here an example of a type safe template written in React: https://github.com/nonblocking/mashroom/blob/master/packages/plugin-packages/mashroom-portal-demo-alternative-theme/src/backend/views/portal.tsx

### Adding new Plugins

All modules added to the *plugin-packages* folders are scanned automatically.

You can also add plugins as *dependencies* in the root *package.json*.
In that case you have to add the path to the installed package (in node_modules) to the *pluginPackageFolders* in *mashroom.json*.

## Development

All plugins can be developed standalone:

* Example React App: Run *npm run dev* in the *example-react-app* folder
* Example Theme: Run *npm run dev* in the *example-theme* folder and open http://localhost:6060
